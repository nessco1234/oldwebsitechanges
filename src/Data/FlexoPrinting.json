    "Description": " This machine has an accurate color printing process as it uses rolling materials. It has meter counter that can set printing quantity and color usability as per utility. This machine is equipped with hydraulic systems which assists independent unwinding and rewinding of paper roll. One can complete whole roll to roll printing process in one machine including unwinding (feeding paper roll), printing in various colors, infrared drying and rewinding (assorting printed paper in one roll) as well. Nessco flexographic machine supports multi-colour printing and is equipped with ultraviolet infrared drying devices which are fixed at each print unit.",
