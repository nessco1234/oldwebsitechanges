    "Description": "Experience unparalleled efficiency with our Servo Driven Paper Cup Machine, a marvel of engineering that integrates advanced mechanical, electronic, pneumatic, and electrical technologies. This high-precision machine is equipped with 13 servos that work in perfect sync via PLC, enabling the production of up to 180 high-quality paper cups per minute, equivalent to 3 cups per second. The machine features a two-step curling process, which ensures the rim of each cup is curled twice to provide extra rigidity and durability & High-quality sealing is guaranteed through the use of ultrasonic and hot air mechanisms, minimizing the risk of leakage, making it ideal for both hot and cold beverages.",

        "The Servo Driven Paper Cup Machine can accommodate a wide range of cup sizes from 4 oz to 26 oz. It includes innovative features such as a conveyor blank feeder with rotary feeding system, element hot air blower, ultrasonic unit, aluminium mould cone, and a waste bottom reel cutter. Additional components include a waste bottom conveyor out, auto bottom feeder with stepper, pre-bottom feeder with a gear motor, and a bottom reel pneumatic loader. The machine also boasts a pre-fold paraffin dispenser (2PE), a 2PE cooling kit, a curling heater, and a full safety frame to ensure operational safety. Control and efficiency are further enhanced by PLC + HMI integration, which manages both the machineâ€™s operations and the auto collection of finished cups. Optional features such as a Leister heater for the hot air blower and a transfer table for integration with double or ripple wall machines are available to customize the machine to specific production needs.
