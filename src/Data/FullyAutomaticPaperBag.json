Twisted paper rope handle machine consists of four different units including Handle forming unit, handle slitting blade, hot melt glue tank and paper loading unit. The rollers twist the paper rope in initial phase, then paper rope handles are being cut to desired length using a steel slitting blade. Afterwards, glue is applied to paper rope handles which gets pasted easily to bag. The machine is more convenient, efficient and stable while in operation. One can produce paper bags of various applications like shopping bags, gift/goodies bags, carry bags, food bags and many more."
